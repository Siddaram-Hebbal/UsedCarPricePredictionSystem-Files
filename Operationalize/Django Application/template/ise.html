			Django Template Inheritence
			Loads a template and renders it with the current context. This is a way of “including” other templates within a template.
			The template name can either be a variable or a hard-coded (quoted) string, in either single or double quotes.

        <p align = "justify">Every search engine displays only 2-3 lines of required information along with the website link for any search. If the newsreader wants to read this, he or she must open every link sequentially or in different tabs, which is time-consuming and tedious. With news, people are very specific about the summary. Some newsreaders wish to see only positive content, some wish to see only the negative content and finally, some people do not bother reading the summary. Existing search engines have the above-stated problems. The software we are proposing will display the content up to 30 lines of required information with a collapsible link for more information and source website address. With the help of this software, we can avoid opening multiple links sequentially. A unique feature that is being added is a sentimental analysis. Furthermore, the software will have a filter option to select sentiments like positive or negative. If the user does not bother about sentiments, then they should select the not applicable option.</p>

      <p align = "justify">These people search for any news topics they are interested in. The topic that they need to search should be typed in the search bar and select one of the sentiment options. Sentiment can be Positive, Negative or Not Applicable. For example: If a newsreader called John wants to search for the topic ‘Winter in Regina’ and is interested only in the negative aspects of the topic, then he will search for the topic by typing ‘Winter in Regina’ in the search bar, selects the sentiment ‘Negative’ and hits the enter button.</p>
