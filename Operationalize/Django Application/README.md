## Why Django was used as a web framework?

* Accelerates custom web application development

* Designed as a batteries-included web framework

* Supports MVC programming paradigm

* Compatible with major operating systems and databases

* Provides robust security features

* Easy to extend and scale

* Supported by a large and active community

## Why Heroku and not AWS?

* Easy setup - as a PaaS you don't need to know how to install and configure Apache, nginx, unicorn, passenger, MySQL, Postgres etc

* Free of Cost for creating an account

* Easy deployment steps (Just connect your GitHub and deploy)

* Easier to scale initially - spin up more dynos, size up DBs etc

* Great plugin support for third party apps
