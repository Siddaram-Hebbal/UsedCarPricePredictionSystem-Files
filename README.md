# Installation tools

### Below are some tools that you can download, now itâ€™s a preference, so download whichever that fits the best for you.

| Name of the tools | 
| ------------- |
|[Python download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)|
|[Pycharm download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)|
|[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)|
|[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)|
|[Visual Studio IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)|
|[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)|



<p align="justify"> For those of you who aren't aware of Pycharm: PyCharm is an integrated development environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains (Psss, copied from Wikipedia).</p>

<p align = "justify">I personally use Google Colab for python programming. It's one of the best interactive tool in the world. I like it because I can provide more documentation to the code and write some quality tutorials.</p>

<b>Also, you might wanna install the necessary libraries in your terminal (Command Prompt), because you need to manually install them<b>
There are two ways you can do this
1. Download from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Used_Car_Price_Prediction_System1/blob/master/requirements.txt) file 
  
2. Manually install them from below:

    2.1 `Django==3.0.3`
    
    2.2 `googletrans==2.4.0`
    
    2.3 `gunicorn==20.0.4`
    
    2.4 `matplotlib==3.1.3`
    
    2.5 `numpy==1.18.1`
    
    2.6 `pandas==1.0.1`
    
    2.7 `scikit-learn==0.22.2.post1`
    
To install any of the above library navigate to your command prompt and then tell `pip install library-name`. If you don't have `pip` installed already then you might see a error. Download it [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

# Nbviewer

<b align = "justify">If the jupyter notebook doesn't load. Don't worry just copy and paste the link to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). Because most of my jupyter notebooks are not loading.</b>
