## Data Analytic Life Cycle

Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field. Altogether, data science is the science involved in studying the data. Data Analysis which is a part of data science has a life cycle composed of 6 phases. These phases include: Discovery, Data Preparation, Model Planning, Model Building, Communicate Results and Operationalize. The detailed data analytic life cycle can be found below:

This project completely follows the data analytic life cycle. All the 6 phases can be seen above. These phases must be thoroughly understood by all the executives, engineers and analysts before moving to the user guide.

1. Discovery: In this phase the introduction followed by problem statement along with the current situation and the desired situation was drafted. All this detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Discovery.ipynb).

2. Data Preparation: In this step all the necessary steps taken to prepare the data such as extraction,transformation,  loading  the  data  would  be  performed.   Further  the  data  was  be explored and conditioned by visualizing the results. The details of the data preparation can be found [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Data_Preparation.ipynb)

Shown below is the data set and its details.

3. Model Planning: In this phase all the variables were selected by performing the Chi-squared test and heat maps were used to select the most important variables. Also the model selection, category of techniques were performed. For more details visit [here] (https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Model_Planning.ipynb)

4. Model Building: In this phase splitting the data sets into 3 sets, choosing the model, checking for overfitting and underfitting conditions and the hyperparameter tuning were performed. For more details visit [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Model_Building.ipynb)

5. Communicate Results: In this phase all the findings, necessary steps to enhance the model along with the technical documentation, tool and users of the application was discussed. For more details visit [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/tree/master/Communicate\%20Results)

6. Operationalize: In this phase the django web application was built to predict the price was built. All the process details was given along  with elucidating the prominent features and working of the application.

## Source Code User Guide for Engineers and Analysts

### Prerequisites
Below are some of the basic prerequisites that must be followed or being aware of:

1. Required Hardware Configuration<: You don't need a computer with super-high specifications to run this project. But the higher the better. For example my system specifications is as shown below. Make sure your system meets these requirements. Keep your RAM as free as you can.

After having a look at the specifications it's now time to run the code. Follow the steps below for successful execution

1. Install Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. If the code takes a lot of time to execute in Google Colab then user Jupyter Notebook instead.
