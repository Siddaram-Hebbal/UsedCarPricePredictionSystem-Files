## Data Analytic Life Cycle

Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field. Altogether, data science is the science involved in studying the data. Data Analysis which is a part of data science has a life cycle composed of 6 phases. These phases include: Discovery, Data Preparation, Model Planning, Model Building, Communicate Results and Operationalize. The detailed data analytic life cycle can be found below:

This project completely follows the data analytic life cycle. All the 6 phases can be seen above. These phases must be thoroughly understood by all the executives, engineers and analysts before moving to the user guide.

1. Discovery: In this phase the introduction followed by problem statement along with the current situation and the desired situation was drafted. All this detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Discovery.ipynb).

2. Data Preparation: In this step all the necessary steps taken to prepare the data such as extraction,transformation,  loading  the  data  would  be  performed.   Further  the  data  was  be explored and conditioned by visualizing the results. The details of the data preparation can be found [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Data_Preparation.ipynb)

Shown below is the data set and its details.
