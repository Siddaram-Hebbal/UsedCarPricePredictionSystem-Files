Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field. Altogether, data science is the science involved in studying the data. Data Analysis which is a part of data science has a life cycle composed of 6 phases. These phases include: Discovery, Data Preparation, Model Planning, Model Building, Communicate Results and Operationalize. The detailed data analytic life cycle can be found below:

This project completely follows the data analytic life cycle. All the 6 phases can be seen above. These phases must be thoroughly understood by all the executives, engineers and analysts before moving to the user guide.

1. Discovery: In this phase the introduction followed by problem statement along with the current situation and the desired situation was drafted. All this detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/UsedCarPricePredictionSystem-Files/blob/master/Discovery.ipynb).
