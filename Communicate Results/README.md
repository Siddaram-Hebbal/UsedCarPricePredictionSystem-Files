# Desired Situation

In this desired situation as shown in the above figure, now an extra phase or step is being added which is <b>“Data Science Model”</b> which is also known as <b>“Used Car Price Prediction System”</b>. Here, rather than entering vague price of the car, the users can get an estimated price predicted by the system and then they can use the generated price for the online application. Now in the data science model, the user must enter all the features of their car and then get the predicted price. The users can now trust the price generated by the system and end up not getting disappointed. With the help of predicted price by the model, the both the users can buy/sell their cars online or offline.
